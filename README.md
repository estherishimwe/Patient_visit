### **1. Introduction**

This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of patient visit data, going beyond simple reporting to include predictive modeling. The primary goal is to identify key trends, understand the factors that influence patient satisfaction, and build a simple model to predict satisfaction scores. The insights gained can be used to improve operational efficiency and the overall patient experience.

The project is structured in two main parts:
* **Python Analytics:** A script for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a basic linear regression model.
* **Power BI Visualization:** An interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and the results of the analysis.

### **2. Project Structure and Deliverables**

The repository for this project contains the following key files:

* `patient_visit.py`: The Python script that performs the full data analysis pipeline.
* `patient_v.csv`: The raw dataset used as the input for the analysis.
* `patient_data_cleaned.csv`: The output file generated by the Python script, containing a cleaned and prepared version of the raw data. This file is the primary data source for the Power BI dashboard.
* `Patient_Visits_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix`: The Power BI file containing the interactive dashboard for data visualization.
* `satisfaction_score_distribution.png`: A histogram visualizing the distribution of patient satisfaction scores.
* `wait_time_vs_satisfaction.png`: A box plot exploring the relationship between wait times and patient satisfaction scores.
* `avg_wait_time_by_gender.png`: A bar plot comparing average wait times across different genders.

### **3. Methodology**

The analysis follows a clear, multi-stage process, with key code snippets from `patient_visit.py` included below.

#### **3.1 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

This step focused on transforming the raw data into a clean, usable format. Irrelevant columns were removed, data types were corrected (especially for the `Date` column), and inconsistencies in categorical features like `Gender` were addressed. Missing values were handled by dropping the rows to ensure the integrity of the predictive model.

**Code Snippet: Data Cleaning**
```python
# Drop unnecessary columns
df_cleaned = df.drop(columns=['Patient ID', 'First Name', 'Last Name'])

# Convert 'Date' to datetime objects and handle potential conversion errors
df_cleaned['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_cleaned['Date'], format='%d/%m/%Y %H:%M', errors='coerce')
df_cleaned.dropna(subset=['Date'], inplace=True)

# Handle inconsistencies in 'Gender'
df_cleaned['Gender'] = df_cleaned['Gender'].replace('NC', pd.NA)
df_cleaned.dropna(subset=['Gender'], inplace=True)

# Handle missing 'Satisfaction Score' values by dropping rows
df_cleaned.dropna(subset=['Satisfaction Score'], inplace=True)
```
### **3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA involved generating visualizations to uncover initial insights and understand the data's characteristics. This includes the distribution of satisfaction scores, the relationship between wait times and satisfaction, and average wait times by gender. The script saves these plots as image files.

Code Snippet: Wait Time vs. Satisfaction Plot

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))
sns.boxplot(x='Satisfaction Score', y='Wait Time', data=df_cleaned)
plt.title('Relationship between Wait Time and Satisfaction Score')
plt.xlabel('Satisfaction Score')
plt.ylabel('Wait Time (minutes)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.savefig('wait_time_vs_satisfaction.png')
plt.show()
```
### **3.3 Feature Engineering**
New features were created from the Date column to enrich the dataset for the predictive model. These include the hour, day_of_week, and a custom time_of_day category (Morning_Peak, Evening_Peak, etc.).

Code Snippet: Feature Engineering
```python
df_cleaned['hour'] = df_cleaned['Date'].dt.hour

def get_time_of_day(hour):
    if 6 <= hour < 10:
        return 'Morning_Peak'
    elif 16 <= hour < 20:
        return 'Evening_Peak'
    elif 10 <= hour < 16:
        return 'Daytime_OffPeak'
    else:
        return 'Night_OffPeak'

df_cleaned['time_of_day'] = df_cleaned['hour'].apply(get_time_of_day)
```

### **3.4 Predictive Modeling**
A basic linear regression model was built to predict the Satisfaction Score based on a set of features including Age, Wait Time, Gender, and the newly engineered time-based features. The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Code Snippet: Model Training and Evaluation
```python
X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=['Gender', 'Race', 'Department Referral', 'time_of_day'], drop_first=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Model Performance:")
print(f"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {mae:.2f}")
print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse:.2f}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2:.2f}")
```

### **4. Key Insights**
Wait Time is a Key Predictor: The analysis and model confirm that Wait Time is a significant factor in predicting patient satisfaction.

Data-Driven Feature Engineering: New features derived from the date and time of visits proved valuable in enhancing the predictive power of the model.

Potential for Improvement: The model performance metrics provide a baseline that can be improved upon with more complex models or additional features.

### **5. Tools and Technologies**
Python: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and modeling. Key libraries include pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Power BI: Used for building an interactive and insightful dashboard for business intelligence and reporting.

CSV: The format for the raw and cleaned datasets.
